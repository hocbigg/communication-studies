# Summary

The Communication Studies curriculum is a complete education in Communication Studies using online materials.

## Organization

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;
- **[Projects](projects.md)**: support learning through practical application throughout the curriculum.

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Practical work is integrated through the [Projects section](projects.md) and may be undertaken alongside coursework.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

# Curriculum

## How to use this curriculum

### Core

Everyone should complete the following four sections in sequence (before moving to [Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)). They form the essential foundation that every communication student needs:

1. **Foundations of Communication**  
   Start here. This section introduces the most basic ideas and skills you will use in every later part of the field.

2. **Human Interaction & Meaning**  
   Move to this next. It builds directly on the foundations and focuses on how people create meaning and connect with each other face-to-face.

3. **Media, Culture & Power**  
   Study this third. It expands your view from personal interaction to how large-scale media and cultural systems shape communication.

4. **Research Methods in Communication**  
   Finish the core with this section. It gives you the practical tools to read, evaluate, and eventually carry out communication research yourself.
