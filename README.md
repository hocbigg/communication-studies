# Curriculum

## How to use this curriculum

### Core

Everyone should complete the following four sections in sequence. They form the essential foundation that every communication student needs:

1. **I. Foundations of Communication**  
   Start here. This section introduces the most basic ideas and skills you will use in every later part of the field.

2. **II. Human Interaction & Meaning**  
   Move to this next. It builds directly on the foundations and focuses on how people create meaning and connect with each other face-to-face.

3. **III. Media, Culture & Power**  
   Study this third. It expands your view from personal interaction to how large-scale media and cultural systems shape communication.

4. **V. Research Methods in Communication**  
   Finish the core with this section. It gives you the practical tools to read, evaluate, and eventually carry out communication research yourself.

### Advanced

The remaining four sections are **optional specialization tracks**. You do not need to study all of them. Pick one (or at most two) that match your personal interests, career goals, or curiosity after you finish the core.

- **IV. Rhetoric & Persuasion**  Choose this track if you want to learn how to create convincing messages, speeches, advertisements, campaigns, or public arguments.

- **VI. Digital Communication Systems**  Choose this track if you are especially interested in social media platforms, algorithms, online networks, data, and digital life.

- **VII. Applied & Professional Communication** Choose this track if you want practical skills for jobs in public relations, marketing, corporate communication, international work, or professional settings.

- **VIII. Advanced Analysis & Theory**  Choose this track if you are very interested in deep critical thinking, academic-style analysis, or if you plan to continue into graduate-level study later.
